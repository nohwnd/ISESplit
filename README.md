ISESplit
========

###ISESplit is a proof of concept. 

ISE PowerShell editor won't let you split the right half of the window
horizontally which leads to wasting a lot of screen space. This proof of
concept loads to the right panel and scans loaded assemblies for ISE
AddOns (all types that implement IAddOnToolHostObject).

It is possibly full of bugs and the native AddOns do not even work properly, 
I just wanted to see if it will work at all, and if this idea is worth pursuing.
